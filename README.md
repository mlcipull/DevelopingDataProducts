Location with final project files

I had some issues loading it to the shinyapps.io server. I went through many help articles, and I'm not sure how to fix it as none of the suggestions I found worked.

If you would please take these 3 files (server.R, ui.R, and helpers.R) and run the app, it should work appropraitely. I have attached a png file of what the app looks like when it's run. This project requires the package extRemes. If you already have the extRemes package, it should run fine. If you do not, please run install.packages('extRemes') before running. This is also an option that can be uncommented in the helpers.R file.

Thank you
