Location with final project files

I had some issues loading it to the shinyapps.io server. I went through many help articles, and I'm not sure how to fix it as none of the suggestions I found worked.

If you would please take these 3 files (server.R, ui.R, and helpers.R) and run the app, it should work appropraitely. I have attaced a png file of what the app looks like when it's run. This project requires the package extRemes
